I'm born & brought from Hyderabad, India, completed an undergraduate in Electrical & Communication department in the year 2016.  Since I'm not from CS background spent most of my time understanding programming concepts. I've had almost 3years of work experience at Doche Cloud Technologies (DCT), as MEAN stack and Python developer along with few services from AWS, Azure, Google Cloud.
